        "Determine what is the most urgent and important thing for today. What can you do about it? How? And act now so that no obstacles dissuade you from achieving the result. There is no need to discuss, ask for approval, or convince. Don‚Äôt let yourself be drawn into verbal games that will only waste your energy. A good day for comrades ‚Äúon their own‚Äù who quietly but persistently stick to their line. There are two dangers of this day. First: spend your energy on words, not on deeds. Second: say too much. Promise, agree, spill information, boast, etc. To your own detriment.",
        "This is the most productive day for you. If you know everything for sure, have weighed, calculated and estimated your options - go ahead! If not, you will simply be ‚Äúcarried‚Äù on a wave of feelings. Uncontrollable desires, whims, impenetrable stubbornness... Who's going to stop you, come on, to your health! It‚Äôs all a matter of how to deal with it later, and the consequences will not be obvious and not quick. But irreparable.",
        "If you don‚Äôt have a goal for today and don‚Äôt have a clear plan, you‚Äôll be tugged at by everyone and everything you can think of, and you‚Äôll spend the day in empty troubles and fuss. Communicate less. Loneliness and concentration are the most effective behavior model if you need to achieve something. The danger of this day is that there may be tearfulness, touchiness out of the blue, or a wave of some old pain that has not been experienced in its time will cover you. Don't dive into these sad waters, don't. These are all stars, soon your mental well-being will brighten.",
        "The most favorable day for business contacts and discussion of practical issues. Hide your emotions away. You find the necessary convincing words, present not only your arguments, but also make it clear that you also understand the position of your interlocutor. And there is no need to rush to end the conversation quickly, be patient, things can still turn around. Confirm the agreement by repeating the results out loud again. The same applies to the preparation of papers and documents of a legal or official nature.",
        "Today you are precise, extremely specific and cold-blooded. By weighing each word, you understand what reaction it can cause in the listener. There are no impulsive emotional decisions today. A good day for studying technical issues, discussing business and personal problems - most discussions will be constructive. Proceed from considerations of practicality, but for the long term. Winning a momentary battle can result in unpleasant long-term consequences.",
        "Today is a day just to de-stress. The best thing is active rest and physical activity. Forget about everything, turn off tasks and plans from your head. Recover yourself! Things can wait. Let me note that getting some sleep or just lying around won‚Äôt work, as you won‚Äôt turn off your ‚Äúrecord‚Äù and won‚Äôt gain new energy. Move, walk, go to the gym or to the park, or to the sea. Communication also takes energy.",
        "Mercury is at a tight angle to Uranus, but good to Mars. Too much excitement, turmoil. Events can come quickly, and feelings can overwhelm you. Your task is to control yourself. On the other hand, for those who are in the mood to invent, to act creatively, this is a great day. Today nothing holds back the imagination, and the mind works clearly and quickly. Try not to miss details and nuances; big-picture thinking usually misses all sorts of little things, and they are important."
